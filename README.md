Automate your deployments on Heroku easily.

## üî® Setup

#### Add this Buildpack in your Heroku app 
   In dashboard:
   
   You can copy the [link](https://github.com/diezep/heroku-buildpack-flutter) of this repository and paste it in buildpacks or write **diezep/flutter** and will be added automatically.
   
   In Heroku CLI:
   ```shellscript
   $ heroku buildpacks:set diezep/flutter -a <Heroku App name>
   ```

#### Optional

   You can add optional [environment variables](#-environment-variables) to customize the deployment of your project but nothing is required, all are optional.
   
#### Problems to compile
  By default, this buildpack get the **last version** of Flutter automatically, sometimes because is on beta channel, that version may have problems to compile a project with web support in cloud services.
  
  If this is your case, you can try downgrade the Flutter version manually, add FLUTTER_VERSION variable in your Heroku environment with the number of the version that are currently working web support.

## üìù Final note
   This buildpack is unofficial that means i don't have any conection with Heroku or Google from Flutter developer team <!--Although I would like belonging to any of the two :D -->. This repository was made as a hobby, i'm always interested in learn new things, this is one demostration of that :)
